# Digantara

This project implements three algorithms as REST APIs using FastAPI in Python:
- **Binary Search**: Find an element in a sorted array.
- **Quick Sort**: Sort an array.
- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**: Traverse a graph from a given starting node.

Each API call is logged in `api_logs.json`.
